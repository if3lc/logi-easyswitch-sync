# Installation

## Updating to a newer version

**AUR:** update with your helper — `yay -Syu` (or `paru -Syu`) picks up new releases automatically.

**Pre-built binary:** download the new release archive and run the installer again — it will overwrite the existing binary. No need to uninstall first.

**Installed from source:** pull the latest changes and reinstall:
```bash
git pull
pip install .
```

---

## macOS

### Option 1: Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew tap mikalaibarysevich/cleverswitch
brew trust mikalaibarysevich/cleverswitch
brew install cleverswitch
brew services start cleverswitch
```

`brew trust` is required once because this is a personal tap rather than a core Homebrew formula — without it, Homebrew refuses to load the formula.

`brew services start` runs CleverSwitch immediately and again at every login. Logs are written to `$(brew --prefix)/var/log/cleverswitch.log`.

On first run, macOS will prompt for **Input Monitoring** permission.
If no prompt appears, grant it manually:

1. Open **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Input Monitoring**.
2. Click the **+** button.
3. Press **Cmd + Shift + G**, paste `/opt/homebrew/bin/cleverswitch` (Apple Silicon) or `/usr/local/bin/cleverswitch` (Intel), and click Open.

### Option 2: Pre-built binary

1. Download `cleverswitch_macOS.tar.gz` from the [Releases](https://github.com/MikalaiBarysevich/CleverSwitch/releases) page.
2. Double-click the downloaded file to extract it — a `cleverswitch_macOS` folder will appear.
3. Open the folder and double-click **`install.command`**.
   A Terminal window will open and guide you through the setup, including an option to launch CleverSwitch automatically on login.

On first run, macOS will prompt for **Input Monitoring** permission.
If no prompt appears, grant it manually:

1. Open **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Input Monitoring**.
2. Click the **+** button.
3. Press **Cmd + Shift + G**, paste `~/.local/bin/cleverswitch`, and click Open.

### Option 3: From source

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open Terminal and navigate to the project folder.
3. Run:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/mac/install_from_sources.sh
./scripts/mac/install_from_sources.sh
```

The script installs Homebrew (if needed), Python, and CleverSwitch via pip. It also offers to set up launch-at-login.

## Windows

### Option 1: Pre-built binary (recommended)

1. Download `cleverswitch_windows_x64.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/MikalaiBarysevich/CleverSwitch/releases) page.
2. Right-click the downloaded file and choose **Extract All**, then open the extracted folder.
3. Double-click **`install.bat`**.
   The installer will copy `cleverswitch.exe` to your user programs folder, add it to your PATH, and offer to set up startup.

> If Windows shows a security prompt, click **Run anyway** (the file is safe — Windows warns about unrecognised publishers by default).

### Option 2: From source

_Requires Python >=3.10 on PATH._

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install:
```bash
pip install .
```
3. Run:
```bash
cleverswitch
```

**Windows note:** The [hidapi DLL](https://github.com/libusb/hidapi/releases) must be downloaded manually and placed in a directory on your `PATH`.

## Linux

### Option 1: AUR (Arch, Manjaro, EndeavourOS, CachyOS…)

Install from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cleverswitch) with your preferred helper:
```bash
yay -S cleverswitch
```
or

```bash
paru -S cleverswitch
```

This installs the `cleverswitch` command, the udev rule for non-root HID access, and a systemd **user** service — all managed by pacman, so upgrades and removal are automatic. After installing:

1. **Replug your Logitech receiver** once so the udev rule takes effect.
2. Enable autostart on login (optional):
```bash
systemctl --user enable --now cleverswitch.service
```

### Option 2: Pre-built binary (other distros)

1. Download `cleverswitch_linux.tar.gz` from the [Releases](https://github.com/MikalaiBarysevich/CleverSwitch/releases) page.
2. Extract the archive — most desktop environments let you right-click and choose **Extract Here**.
3. Open a terminal inside the extracted folder and run:
```bash
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

The installer copies the binary to `~/.local/bin/`, checks that the directory is on your PATH, installs udev rules for non-root HID access (with your confirmation), and offers to run CleverSwitch as a systemd user service on login.

### Option 3: From source

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
3. Run:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/linux/install_from_sources.sh
./scripts/linux/install_from_sources.sh
```

The script checks for Python 3, installs CleverSwitch via pip, sets up udev rules, and optionally sets up a systemd user service to start on login.

## Run on Startup

### macOS

**Homebrew:** `brew services start cleverswitch` runs CleverSwitch now and at every login; `brew services stop cleverswitch` disables it.

For the pre-built binary or source install, this is handled by `install.command` or `install_from_sources.sh`. To set up separately:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/mac/setup_startup.command
./scripts/mac/setup_startup.command
```

### Windows

Handled by `install.bat` during installation. To set up separately, run `setup_startup_windows.bat` from the folder containing `cleverswitch.exe`.

To verify, open Task Manager and look for `cleverswitch.exe` in the **Details** tab.

### Linux

CleverSwitch runs as a systemd **user** service.

**AUR:** the package ships the unit; just enable it — `systemctl --user enable --now cleverswitch.service`.

**Pre-built binary / source:** handled by `install.sh` or `install_from_sources.sh` during installation. To set it up separately, run:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/linux/setup_startup.sh
./scripts/linux/setup_startup.sh
```
This installs `~/.config/systemd/user/cleverswitch.service`, which auto-restarts on failure and logs to journald. Control it with:
```bash
systemctl --user status cleverswitch         # check state
systemctl --user restart cleverswitch        # restart
systemctl --user disable --now cleverswitch  # stop and remove from login
journalctl --user -u cleverswitch -f         # follow logs
```
It runs inside your graphical session, so it starts at login (not at boot before login — which is what the udev HID access rule requires).

## Uninstall

### macOS

**Homebrew:**
```bash
brew services stop cleverswitch
brew uninstall cleverswitch
```

**Pre-built binary / source:** open the `cleverswitch_macOS` folder and double-click **`uninstall.command`**. This stops and removes the launch agent (if configured) and removes the CleverSwitch binary.

### Linux

**AUR:** disable the service (if enabled) and remove the package — pacman deletes the binary, udev rule, and service file:
```bash
systemctl --user disable --now cleverswitch.service
yay -R cleverswitch      # or: paru -R cleverswitch
```

**Pre-built binary / source:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/linux/uninstall.sh
./scripts/linux/uninstall.sh
```

This stops and removes the systemd user service (and any XDG autostart entry), removes the binary from `~/.local/bin/`, uninstalls the CleverSwitch pip package if present, and optionally removes udev rules.

### Windows

Double-click **`uninstall.bat`** (included in the release archive).

This removes the startup entry, removes `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\CleverSwitch\` from your PATH, and deletes the install directory.
