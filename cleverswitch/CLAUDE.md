# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project overview

Headless Python daemon that synchronizes Logitech Easy-Switch host switching between a keyboard and mouse. When the keyboard's Easy-Switch button is pressed, CleverSwitch detects the HID++ notification and immediately sends the same CHANGE_HOST command to the mouse — so both switch together.

Communication is via **HID++ 2.0** directly over the Logitech **Bolt USB receiver** (or Unifying receiver / Bluetooth).

## Project specific rules
- For any hid command related work/question ask dedicated @hidpp-protocol-expert agent
- Delegate all design work to the @software-architect agent
- If a code change implies touching more than 5 files delegate it to the @senior-fullstack-engineer agent
- Never assume. If you don't know what to do - you must ask.
- You must design with existing event-driven architecture in mind first.

## Tech stack

- **Python 3.14+**
- `hid` — cross-platform HID access
- `pyyaml` — config file parsing
- `bleak` + `pyobjc-framework-CoreBluetooth` — macOS-only, used by `HidGatewayBLE` for the BLE notify path
- `pytest` + `pytest-mock` + `pytest-cov` — testing
- `ruff` — linting and formatting (line-length 120)
- All log calls must use f-strings: `log.info(f"wpid=0x{wpid:04X}")` — never `%s`/`%d` style. `wpid` and `pid` values must always be formatted as `0x{value:04X}`.

## Development commands

```bash
# Full pre-commit check (tests + format + lint) — run before committing

```

## Architecture

### Pub-sub event system

The core of the architecture is a typed pub-sub system with one daemon thread per subscriber.

**`Topics`** (`topic/topics.py`) is a typed dataclass with five channels:
- `hid_event` — all inbound HID++ events (DeviceConnectedEvent, HidppResponseEvent, HidppNotificationEvent, HidppErrorEvent, TransportDisconnectedEvent, etc.)
- `write` — outbound HID messages (WriteEvent)
- `device_info` — triggers device setup (DeviceInfoRequestEvent)
- `flags` — apply/re-apply key reporting flags (SetReportFlagEvent); `SetReportFlagSubscriber` selects analytics mode (byte 9) or divert mode (byte 6) based on `device.supported_flags`
- `info_progress` — task completion feedback (InfoTaskProgressEvent)

**`Topic`** (`topic/topic.py`) — each `subscribe(subscriber)` call creates a private `queue.Queue` and a daemon thread that drains it by calling `subscriber.notify(event)`, and returns that queue as a handle. `publish(event)` enqueues on all subscriber queues simultaneously. `unsubscribe(subscription)` takes the handle back, removes the queue, and stops its drain thread via an internal sentinel — short-lived subscribers (`InfoTask`) must call it or they leak a thread and a queue for the life of the process.

**Subscribers** implement `notify(event) -> None` and filter by event type internally. All subscribers call `topics.<channel>.subscribe(self)` in `__init__`.

### Device lifecycle

```
discovery.py
  └── HidGatewayReceiver (Bolt/Unifying) | HidGatewayBLE (macOS BT) | HidGatewayBT — one per HID collection, all subclass HidGateway
      └── EventListener (thread, reads raw bytes → parses → publishes to hid_event)
      └── On (re)connect: HidGatewayReceiver calls ConnectionTrigger.trigger() → enables HID++
           notifications + enumerates paired devices → DeviceConnectedEvent(s) on hid_event
      └── On transport drop: HidGatewayReceiver publishes TransportDisconnectedEvent(pid);
           TransportDisconnectionSubscriber fans out one DeviceConnectedEvent(link_established=False)
           per registered device whose pid matches

DeviceConnectionSubscriber.notify(DeviceConnectedEvent)
  ├── idempotence: skips if logi_device.connected == event.link_established (absorbs duplicates
  │     from Windows multi-collection enumeration and the disconnect fan-out)
  ├── new device + cache hit → cached LogiDevice registered, then reconnection path (skips discovery)
  ├── new device + link_established=True  → LogiDevice registered, DeviceInfoRequestEvent published
  ├── new device + link_established=False → skipped (stale pairing entry from receiver enumeration)
  └── reconnect → logi_device.connected updated, SetReportFlagEvent re-published if supported_flags known,
        DeviceInfoRequestEvent published only for still-pending_steps

DeviceInfoSubscriber.notify(DeviceInfoRequestEvent)
  └── starts InfoTask threads: CidReportingFeatureTask, ChangeHostFeatureTask, NameAndTypeFeatureTask, FriendlyNameFeatureTask

InfoTask (Thread + Subscriber)
  ├── doTask() — sends HID++ requests via write topic, blocks on response queue
  ├── on success: removes step from device.pending_steps, fires dependent tasks
  └── publishes InfoTaskProgressEvent to info_progress

InfoTaskOrchestrator.notify(InfoTaskProgressEvent)
  ├── success + pending_steps empty → cache.save(device) FIRST, then applies friendly_name fallback
  │     (copies device.name if friendly_name is None), logs "Device fully discovered" (once per wpid).
  │     Saving before the fallback keeps a genuinely-missing friendly_name persisted as null (re-fetched
  │     next launch) rather than baking in the marketing name.
  └── failure + device.connected → retries the task immediately, up to MAX_DISCOVERY_ATTEMPTS (5)
        for the three steps in _CAPPED_STEPS (CHANGE_HOST, CID_REPORTING, FIND_ES_CIDS_FLAGS);
        on exhaustion logs once at CRITICAL and keeps running. Cosmetic steps retry unbounded.
        The step stays in pending_steps, so the device is never cached and gets a fresh budget
        when DeviceInfoRequestEvent arrives (the orchestrator's second subscription, on
        device_info) — this makes it the only two-topic subscriber, hence the lock on _attempts.
```

### InfoTask design

`InfoTask` (`subscriber/task/info_task.py`) is abstract, `Thread`, and `Subscriber`:
- Subscribes to `hid_event`; `notify()` filters on `slot + pid + sw_id` and enqueues matching `HidppResponseEvent` / `HidppErrorEvent`
- `_send_request(*params)` drains the response queue, then builds a long-format HID++ message and publishes a `WriteEvent`. The drain matters: anything already queued predates the request, so without it a late reply would be handed to the *next* `_wait_response`, and the chunked name reads and the `getCidInfo` sweep would splice it in at the wrong offset and silently record wrong data. A clean timeout is the honest outcome. Tests must therefore deliver responses **on publish** (`tests/task_helpers.py:deliver_on_request`), not by pre-loading `_response_queue`
- `_wait_response(timeout=2.0)` blocks on the private queue; returns `None` on timeout
- `run()` checks `step_name in device.pending_steps`; skips `doTask()` if already complete; always publishes `InfoTaskProgressEvent`; releases the `hid_event` subscription in a `finally` — a subclass overriding `run()` must preserve that

Task dependency chain:
- `CidReportingFeatureTask` → fires `FindESCidsFlagsTask`
- `NameAndTypeFeatureTask` → fires `GetDeviceTypeTask` + `GetDeviceNameTask`
- `FriendlyNameFeatureTask` → fires `GetDeviceFriendlyNameTask`
- `ChangeHostFeatureTask` has no dependents

Each task type has an `sw_id` constant in `subscriber/task/constants.py`. The sw_id is a 4-bit nibble whose bit 3 must be set (`SW_ID_MASK`), so **8–15 is the entire space and every value is already allocated** — including `SW_ID = 0x08`, `SW_ID_DIVERT = 0x0E` and `SW_ID_HOST_CHANGE = 0x0F` in `hidpp/constants.py`. Two are already double-booked: `SW_ID_DIVERT` equals `FEATURE_DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME_SW_ID`, and `SW_ID_HOST_CHANGE` equals `GET_DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME_SW_ID`. A shared sw_id is survivable because `Topic.publish` copies each event into *every* subscriber's own queue: a collision can only put noise in the wrong task's queue, never steal a response from the right one. Filter precisely (by function code where needed), and rely on `_send_request`'s drain for the rest.

### Receiver enable-notifications message

`ReceiverConnectionTrigger` sends `ENABLE_HIDPP_NOTIFICATIONS_MESSAGE` (SET_REGISTER 0x00 with `r1=0x09`: wireless notifications + software present) before the enumeration message. The receiver's register 0x00 is RAM-only and defaults to 0 at USB power-up, which blocks 0x41 device-connection notifications. Without enabling first, fresh-plugged receivers (notably on macOS) deliver no connection events. The trigger fires from `HidGatewayReceiver._set_connected(True)` on every (re)connect, so notifications are re-armed automatically after USB re-plug.

### macOS BLE hybrid transport

`HidGatewayBLE` (`gateway/hid_gateway_ble.py`) is a macOS-only subclass of `HidGatewayBT`. `discovery.py` selects it when `device.connection_type == "bluetooth"` and `get_system() == "Darwin"`; all other platforms (and macOS receivers) keep using `HidGatewayBT` / `HidGatewayReceiver`.

It exists because **HID++ reporting is bound to the transport channel that armed it**. CleverSwitch and peer apps (OpenLogi; reportedly Logi Options+) arm the same three Easy-Switch CIDs via 0x1B04 `setCidReporting`, and the device reports a key press only on the channel whose request landed last. CleverSwitch arms over the Logitech GATT characteristic; OpenLogi arms over HID (IOHIDManager). So with a peer app running the press can arrive on either channel depending on who armed last, and reading only one goes deaf. `HidGatewayBLE` therefore reads **both**: `run()` starts the BLE asyncio thread and then calls `super().run()` for the inherited HID read loop.

No deduplication is applied, and none is wanted: channel affinity means a given message is delivered on exactly one channel, so a press cannot arrive twice.

Design:
- **Inbound**: subscribes to the Logitech proprietary GATT characteristic `00010001-0000-1000-8000-011f2000046d` and prepends `[0x11, 0xFF]` to each 18-byte BLE payload, producing a 20-byte HID++ long report identical to what the parser already handles. Peripheral selection probes the standard PnP ID characteristic (`0x2A50`, bytes [3:5] little-endian = WPID) to match the right paired device by `_device_info.pid`.
- **Outbound**: `_do_write` sends via `client.write_gatt_char(LOGI_HIDPP_CHAR, msg[2:], response=True)` so function-call responses come back on the BLE notify channel (Logitech replies on the request's transport). Falls back to `super()._do_write` (HID transport) if BLE is unavailable. `response=True` is required, not an optimisation: bleak never checks `canSendWriteWithoutResponse`, so a write-*without*-response is silently discarded when the OS has no credit — only 1 of 3 `setCidReporting` requests was landing. The with-response path is ATT-acknowledged and serialises the burst.
- **Connect-event ordering**: `_set_connected(True)` is overridden to bypass `HidGatewayBT`'s auto-fire of the synthetic 0x41 connect event. It sets `_connected = True` first to unblock the BLE asyncio thread, then waits on a `threading.Event` (`_ble_subscribed`) until `_connect_and_listen` has called `start_notify`, then publishes the 0x41. This prevents `InfoTask` requests racing the BLE channel coming up. The wait is bounded by `_BLE_SUBSCRIBE_GRACE` (5s): HID is a real read channel now, so a device whose notify path never comes up must still be set up rather than stalling forever. Disconnect fires immediately. If `_BLE_OK` is False (bleak not importable), it fires immediately too.
- **Drop detection**: `BleakClient.disconnected_callback` calls `self._set_connected(False)`, which clears `_ble_subscribed` and fires the 0x41 disconnect via the inherited path so HID's main loop notices and re-enters `_try_connect`.

### LogiDevice state

`model/logi_device.py` — mutable dataclass tracking:
- `available_features: dict[int, int]` — feature code → feature index (populated by feature tasks)
- `pending_steps: set[str]` — setup steps not yet completed
- `supported_flags: set[int]` — ES key capability flags (KEY_FLAG_DIVERTABLE, KEY_FLAG_PERSISTENTLY_DIVERTABLE, KEY_FLAG_ANALYTICS); populated by `FindESCidsFlagsTask` and mutated at runtime by `AnalyticsRejectionSubscriber` (drops `KEY_FLAG_ANALYTICS` on silent rejection); all ES CIDs share the same flags so this is per-device, not per-CID
- `connected: bool` — current connection state (gates orchestrator retries)
- `role`, `name`, `friendly_name` — populated during setup; `name` is the marketing string from feature 0x0005 (e.g. "Wireless Keyboard MX Keys"), `friendly_name` is the short label from feature 0x0007 (e.g. "MX Keys")
- `display_name` property — returns `friendly_name or name`. **All log lines and hook calls must label devices via `device.display_name`, never `device.name` directly**, so the short label is preferred wherever it's available

### Device cache

`DeviceCache` (`cache/device_cache.py`) persists discovered devices to a JSON file so a known device skips HID++ discovery on the next launch. It wraps its own `LogiDeviceRegistry`; entries are whole `LogiDevice` objects serialized via a `DiskCache` dataclass (`model/disk_cache.py`) — `{version, devices: [...]}`, a list keyed internally by wpid.

- **Path**: `config.cache_path`, from config key `cache.path`; defaults to `~/.config/cleverswitch/device_cache.json`. `--clear-cache` deletes the file and exits without starting the daemon.
- **Never crashes startup**: `load()` degrades to empty on any read failure (missing/corrupt file, wrong `version`, malformed `devices`), and skips individual malformed entries.
- **Fits the existing architecture — no new event or topic.** `setup_context()` builds the cache (loaded once) and injects it into `DeviceConnectionSubscriber`, `InfoTaskOrchestrator`, and `AnalyticsRejectionSubscriber`.
  - Read on connect: `DeviceConnectionSubscriber` registers a cache-hit device and runs the reconnection path — arming flags and requesting info only for still-pending steps (so a partially-cached device fetches just the gaps).
  - Written by `InfoTaskOrchestrator.save` on full discovery, and by `AnalyticsRejectionSubscriber` when it drops `KEY_FLAG_ANALYTICS`.
- `save()` writes the whole file atomically (temp file + `os.replace`) and swallows write errors (logs a warning; in-memory entry still updates).

### Wiring

`setup/app_setup.py:setup_context()` creates Topics, LogiDeviceRegistry, the DeviceCache (see [Device cache](#device-cache)), and all subscribers. It is the single place where components are connected.

Active subscribers: `DeviceConnectionSubscriber`, `DeviceInfoSubscriber`, `InfoTaskOrchestrator`, `SetReportFlagSubscriber`, `ExternalUnsetFlagSubscriber`, `AnalyticsRejectionSubscriber`, `HostChangeSubscriber`, `EventHookSubscriber`, `WirelessStatusSubscriber`, `TransportDisconnectionSubscriber`.

The parser detects ES CID presses (fn=0 diverted, fn=2 analytics press-only) and emits `HostChangeEvent` instead of generic `HidppNotificationEvent`. `HostChangeSubscriber` reacts to `HostChangeEvent` and sends CHANGE_HOST to all registered devices.

`EventHookSubscriber` listens on `hid_event` for `HostChangeEvent` and `DeviceConnectedEvent`, and fires user-configured hooks asynchronously via `hooks.py`. Hooks are a named mapping in config (`HooksConfig.hooks: dict[str, HookEntry]`); each entry declares an explicit `path` (run directly, no shell) **or** `command` (run via shell) — never both — plus one or more `type`s (`CONNECT`/`SWITCH`/`DISCONNECT`, scalar or list) and a `timeout`. `HooksConfig.for_type(HookType)` selects the entries an event fires. By default hooks only fire for keyboard events; set `hooks.fire_for_all_devices: true` in config to include mouse events. This global default is overridable per hook via the nullable `HookEntry.fire_for_all_devices` (`None` inherits the global; `True`/`False` widens/narrows just that hook), resolved in `hooks.fire()`. Tracks per-wpid last connection state internally to avoid double-firing hooks from duplicate connection events (e.g. Windows multi-collection re-enumeration).

`TransportDisconnectionSubscriber` listens on `hid_event` for `TransportDisconnectedEvent`; for each registered device whose pid matches the dropped transport, it publishes `DeviceConnectedEvent(link_established=False)` so per-device subscribers react as if each device sent a normal disconnect.

`ExternalUnsetFlagSubscriber` detects when an external app (Solaar, logiops) clears the ES key reporting flag via `setCidReporting` (fn=3, sw_id in 1–7). The parser emits `ExternalUnsetFlagEvent`; the subscriber re-publishes `SetReportFlagEvent` to restore the flag. **Known limitation**: it only sees a peer's `setCidReporting` if that peer shares our transport, and `parser.py` only classifies one as external for sw_id 1–7. On BLE a peer typically arms over HID, so this subscriber has never been observed firing there.

`AnalyticsRejectionSubscriber` detects keyboards that advertise `KEY_FLAG_ANALYTICS` in getCidInfo but silently reject the analytics enable: the device echoes our `setCidReporting` request (sw_id=`SW_ID_DIVERT`, fn=3) with byte 9 cleared to 0x00 instead of the requested 0x03 (observed on the K850). Per the HID++ 2.0 0x1B04 spec, the response is a verbatim echo, so byte 9 = 0x00 is a definitive rejection signal. The subscriber discards `KEY_FLAG_ANALYTICS` from `device.supported_flags`, persists the change via `DeviceCache.save`, and re-publishes `SetReportFlagEvent`; `SetReportFlagSubscriber` then naturally takes the divert branch on the retry.

## Testing conventions

- All HID I/O is mocked — tests never open real devices.
- `conftest.py` in the root `tests/` directory provides `FakeTransport`, `fake_transport`, and `make_fake_transport` fixtures.
- Subscriber tests construct `Topics` with `MagicMock(spec=Topic)` for all channels and assert `publish.assert_called_once()` / `assert_not_called()`. See skill: `@write-subscriber-test`.
- `InfoTask` tests must feed responses with `tests/task_helpers.py:deliver_on_request(task, topics, [...])`, which delivers one response per published request. Pre-loading `task._response_queue` no longer works — `_send_request` drains it, because that ordering cannot happen on real hardware.
- `transport.py` and `__main__.py` are excluded from coverage (hardware I/O and entry point).
- Coverage threshold: **90%** (enforced in `pyproject.toml`).
